This was a fun challenge to put a Stealthburner onto my Taz 6.<br>
This mod may possibly be adaptable to the Taz Workhorse, Taz pro, Taz Pro S, Taz Pro XT, Taz 5, Taz 4, Taz 3, Mini v1.04, Mini v1.03, and Kittaz :)
Please be aware that none of this is perfect and you might have a few bumps along the way while building this.<br><br>
